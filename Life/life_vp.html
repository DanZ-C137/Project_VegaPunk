      <h1>Early Life:</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Vegapunk was born in the Future Country Baldimore on Karakuri Island. As a child, he designed and built several devices in his lab, including robotic animals. He also had hundreds of other ideas, ranging from weapons to experimenting with cellular structures. He once tried to create an in-ground heating system for the island's people using modified animals as his labor force. Unfortunately, Vegapunk lacked the tools and the funds needed to complete his project, but he was able to touch the people's hearts.</p>

      <h1>Personality:</h1>
      <br>
      <p>In his youth, Vegapunk was a generous person who cared very much for the inhabitants of his island, willing to help them with his inventions. He is considered the island's pride and joy, and the residents are still hoping for his return.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Unlike his former fellow scientist Caesar Clown, Vegapunk was far more moral about what he would do in pursuit of achievements. He refused to involve children in the gigantification process despite repeated failures. He also vetoed the creation or release of the H2S poison gas weapon for fear of it harming innocent people.</p>
      <br>
      <p>He seems to have an interest for dragons, as he created two of them on Punk Hazard, and an artificial Devil Fruit that allows the user to transform into one.</p>
      <br>
      <p>He also appears to be honorable as he granted Kuma his final wish as a human being, which was to program Kuma to protect the Thousand Sunny until the Straw Hats return.</p>

      <h1>Relationships:</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>Marines</h3>
      <p>Vegapunk is the leading scientist in the Marines. His work includes discovering the secrets and uses of seastone, the secrets of how Devil Fruit powers work, the co-discovery of the Lineage Factor and its applications, and various other scientific achievements that are said to be at least 500 years ahead of current technology.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Vinsmoke Judge</h3>
      <p>Vegapunk and Judge were formerly research partners and co-leaders of the outlaw research team MADS which discovered the Lineage Factor. The state of their present relationship is unknown.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Caeser Clown</h3>
      <p>Despite once being colleagues, Vegapunk and Caesar Clown had a bitter rivalry based on levels of recognition and ethics. When Caesar's erratic behavior got out of hand, Vegapunk decided to dismiss Caesar from his position. Caesar was also considered second best to Vegapunk. Because of this, Caesar holds a grudge against him.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Bartholomew Kuma</h3>
      <p>Vegapunk seems to have a good enough relationship with Bartholomew Kuma to grant him his final wish as a human being, which was to program Kuma to protect the Thousand Sunny until the Straw Hats return. It is very likely that Vegapunk highly respects Kuma's strength, as he modified Kuma to be the prototype Pacifista, and let Kuma have one final act as a human before becoming a mindless weapon.</p>

    <article class="abilities">
      <h1>Abilities:</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Vegapunk is famed as the greatest scientific genius the world has ever known, having tremendous knowledge and unmatched understanding in all fields of science, from cell biology to military technology. His scientific expertise is said to be at least 500 years ahead of his contemporaries.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It seems that even in his youth, the scientist was a prodigy already considered a genius, but lacked the skills, funds, and materials to develop his inventions, although that did not stop him from theorizing the creation of Pacifista cyborgs, including their laser weapons back then. This is proven by the fact that Franky was able to recreate the technologies by self studying the blueprints Vegapunk left behind on his home island. Regardless, the creations and blueprints that he has left behind are considered invaluable, and any damage inflicted to them is considered a crime.</p>
      <br>
      <p>He also seems to be physically strong, as he was able to survive Caesar Clown's mass murder weapon at its core explosion.</p>
