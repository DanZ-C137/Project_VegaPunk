  <h1>Kuma & Pacifistas</h1>
  <p>The Pacifista are human weapons developed by Vegapunk. They are cyborgs built in the mold of the Warlord Bartholomew Kuma, who was the cyborg prototype for the project.</p>
  <p>As stated by Sentomaru, the funds required for the construction of just one Pacifista are roughly equal to that of a Marine-issued battleship. Sentomaru also noted that after the timeskip period, PX-5 and PX-7 were outdated models from two years ago, meaning that the Pacifista project has been updated and modified.</p>
  <p>All the Pacifista replicas seen thus far have been identical in appearance to Bartholomew Kuma, even in his uncommon body proportion. The only distinguishing features between them and the genuine Kuma are the lack of a Bible and Kuma's Nikyu Nikyu no Mi palm pads, though the latter is not initially apparent as they all wear similar gloves. Each Pacifista is considered to be a copy of Kuma, except for the original one who was gradually converted into a Pacifista. The Pacifista have the voice of Kuma, furthering their genuine replication to him. They are under complete control of the World Government.</p>
  <p>All Pacifista are labeled by the letters "PX", then a hyphen and a number, presumably indicating the order in which they were constructed. The label is printed on the right side of their necks. There appears to be around twenty of them in service as of the Marineford War, though it is unknown how many have been destroyed and built since then.</p>
  <p>The Pacifista are cyborgs, similar to Franky of the Straw Hat Pirates. They are composed of a metal even stronger than steel, as demonstrated when Zoro's attempt to attack the partially-converted Kuma only resulted in a slight gash in the metal, whereas ordinary steel would have been cleaved in two. After striking PX-1 once, Sanji (using Diable Jambe) was forced to note that another kick would break his legs. However, as Franky pointed out, despite all their strengths, they are still human beneath and are capable of bleeding.</p>
  <p>Pacifista can identify wanted pirates on sight using a electronic scope, thus the red glow in the pupils of the eye lenses, that works at a significant distance. It not only lets them know the name of the person in front of them but also their bounty. Their recognition ability is also extremely good, as one was able to identify Luffy while obscured by smoke, in addition to seeing through his heavy clothing and joke mustache disguise; it also distinguished the impostor Luffy's true identity. The real Kuma was also able to identify Franky after the two-year timeskip despite the extensive modifications that the fellow cyborg underwent.</p>
  <p>The Pacifista's main mode of combat is firing laser beams from their mouth and hands which are based on Kizaru's light-based Devil Fruit. These beams possess tremendous piercing power and are capable of causing massive explosions, inflicting severe to fatalistic damage to targets and the environment. Pacifista can also run slightly faster than most people and jump quite high, despite their size, although they are still slower than Kuma himself.</p>
  <h1>Gigantification</h1>
  <p>Gigantification is the procedure to turn naturally born regular-sized people into giants via the means of scientific methods. To date, the perfected version of gigantification has been considered to be impossible to achieve.</p>
  <p>The most practical use of gigantification is for military purposes. According to Trafalgar Law, the reason the World Government has been researching the process is the ability to freely create giant soldiers. If they were to succeed in creating armies of giants, no one could stand up to them.</p>
  <p>However, by Caesar's grudging admission, outright turning people into giants without any side-effects is impossible by scientific means. He believes that taking advantage of children's growth by using drugs is a more practical process, although this would reduce their lifespan from the strain, and even Caesar admits his inability to ensure sustained health and longevity.</p>
  <p>At some point, at least twenty years ago, a research was undertaken on Punk Hazard in an attempt to recreate ancient giants. The subjects, although gaining sizes and strengths comparable to genuine ancient giants, were deemed as failures for reasons yet to be explained. Kaido eventually recruited these failures, all of whom became the subdivision of the Beasts Pirates known as Numbers, and they seemingly have lived on Onigashima since.</p>
  <h1>Secret Weapon</h1>
  <p>Prior to going to Mary Geoise, Issho met with Vegapunk and the scientist revealed an invention that Issho believed could render the Seven Warlords of the Sea system obsolete. The weapon isn't revealed as of yet, but is said to be revealed soon at the end or after Wano arc.</p>
  <p>If this statement comes to be true, it would change the entire dynamic of the World Government and their Three Powers. Either gaining a 4th or introducing a power more severe than the Seven Warlords.</p>
