      <h3 class="dftitle">Devil Fruits</h3>
      <p class="dfparag">Devil Fruits are mysterious, distinctive, highly sought-after fruits scattered throughout the world, known for granting their eaters permanent superhuman powersâ€”and an equally permanent inability to swim. With only one notable exception, an individual can only acquire the powers of a single Devil Fruit and survive. As a whole, Devil Fruits encompass hundreds of different powers, from the mundane to the inherently mass-destructive. These are broadly grouped along three categories: Paramecia, Logia, and Zoan.</p>
