    <h1>Characteristics</h1>
    <p>Paramecia is one of the three Devil Fruit types, being the most common out of them. This type of Devil Fruit allows the user to achieve one of a large variety of abilities that enable their consumers to become superhuman or perform a superhuman feat. The defining aspect of Paramecia fruit abilities is that they do not enable the user to transform into an animal like a Zoan, or transform into a natural element like a Logia. Thus, Paramecia encompasses a massive range of wildly varying powers. That being said, just about every Paramecia ability can be placed in three general categories: altering the user's body, altering the environment, and generating a substance. Some fruits can only fall into one of these categories, while others can fall into multiple depending on how they're used.</p>
    <h1>Different Types</h1>
    <h2>Bodily Alteration</h2>
    <p>Bodily alteration caused by Paramecia fruits comes in many forms. Some fruits permanently change the composition of the user's body; for example, the user of the Gomu Gomu no Mi will always have a rubbery body, and even if they are rendered unable to use their Devil Fruit ability, they will still stretch if acted upon by an outside force. Other Paramecia users are able to alter their body on command, with some users being able to transform certain parts of their body into other things, both organic and inorganic. In almost all instances, abilities that transform body parts into inanimate objects do not make their bodies intangible like a Logia transformation. Alternatively, the user may be able to change a property of their body eg. Suke Suke user becoming invisible.</p>
    <h2>Environmental Alteration</h2>
    <p>Environment-altering Paramecias enable their users to achieve an unnatural effect on their environment. Some of these fruits work best on living organisms, some work best on inanimate objects, and others work equally well on anything. Many of these users are able to alter something around them by simply touching it, while others can produce a certain substance that is used to achieve the desired effect. A few fruits can create a special zone in which their alteration takes effect, such as the Ope Ope no Mi and Nagi Nagi no Mi. An environment altering user may gain a special level of control over a certain type of object, including objects that normal people would not be able to interact with. Several of these fruits can only extend their power to inanimate objects, like the Fuwa Fuwa no Mi and Pamu Pamu no Mi.</p>
    <h2>Substance Generation</h2>
    <p>Finally, some Paramecia fruits are capable of generating a specific substance. Many of these powers resemble Logia users' substance generation, as they typically enable the user to create a near-limitless amount of their substance and shape it with their minds as they please. However, except for the Mochi Mochi no Mi, users of these fruits cannot transform their bodies into a substance like Logia users can. The substances that Paramecia users can generate are distinctive from Logia substances in that Paramecia-generated substances are typically refined and manmade, while Logia substances are naturally occurring. As mentioned above, the only known distinction between the special Paramecia Mochi Mochi no Mi and Logia fruits is that mochi is a manmade substance. Some fruits generate extremely refined objects, such as biscuits, string and clothing. A few fruits can generate forces, like seismic waves and gravity. A few substance generating fruits stand out from the others, as the substances they create are unnatural with very unique effects on the surrounding environment. Additionally, some fruits generate substances which are real but have unusual and sometimes even supernatural properties. These substances include bubbles that can wash away the strength of anyone affected, straw that can deflect damage to others, mucus that is flammable, butter that is adhesive instead of slippery, and cream that can burn skin.</p>
    <h1>Strenghts</h1>
    <p>By eating a Paramecia fruit, a person will receive a superhuman ability, allowing them to perform actions that would be impossible for a normal person to do, and in some instances survive events that would otherwise kill them. Many advantages granted by Paramecia fruits can be applied in battle, particularly if the user is well-trained with their fruit. Some Paramecia fruits are capable of doing more than just harming enemies physically, such as the Horo Horo no Mi which can mentally subdue other people. If a user can alter the environment around them, they may be able to use outside objects to their benefit in battle, or have a particular advantage against a certain type of opponent. For example, the Sabi Sabi no Mi user is particularly dangerous against swordsmen due to their ability to instantly rust metal swords. If a Paramecia user has an altered body, they may be able to play off their environment in ways that would normally be dangerous. Certain Paramecia users' bodies will become immune to the effects of their powers, such as the Doku Doku no Mi user being immune to touching poison, however not every Paramecia user is granted this advantage. A Paramecia fruit may also offer a valuable superhuman skill that goes beyond fighting. Although Paramecia fruits (except for the Mochi Mochi no Mi) do not enable the user to transform their bodies into substances, this means that, unlike Logia users, the substances Paramecia users generate are not considered part of their body. This means that attacking a Paramecia user's generated substance with Busoshoku Haki will not harm the user.</p>
    <h1>Weaknesses</h1>
    <p>Paramecia is the only class of Devil Fruit that contains fruits with little to no use in battle, in contrast to Zoans which are suited for close combat and Logias whose transformations grant massive offensive and defensive power boosts. Other Paramecia fruits have only been shown to be useful against enemies with an advanced application of the power, or strategic usage of it. The Yomi Yomi no Mi is an example of the former, as Brook was never able to use it in battle until becoming able to summon the chills of the underworld to freeze outside objects. Additionally, whether or not a Paramecia user can effectively use their power can often depend on what environment they are in. The Jake Jake no Mi and Gocha Gocha no Mi, which both revolve around combining multiple people's abilities, have little use if there is no other person to operate with the user. Paramecia abilities can frequently be highly complex and tricky for the user to grow accustomed to, so special training is frequently needed to hone the fruit's abilities effectively. One prominent example is the Gomu Gomu no Mi, as Luffy was initially unable to effectively throw a punch while stretching his arm, and needed to train for several years to perform effective long-range attacks. If used improperly or carelessly, a Paramecia ability may be dangerous to its user and any allies the user has around them, especially if the ability is extremely powerful and destructive by nature. Some Paramecia abilities can apply their effect to the user themselves, with a prominent instance being when Luffy was able to slow Foxy down by reflecting his Noro Noro no Mi beam back at him. Paramecia abilities, particularly environment altering ones, typically have some sort of limitation which can at times be arbitrary. An environment altering fruit may only affect inanimate objects, an effect created by a fruit ability may only last for a short time, a body altering user can typically only alter their body by a certain amount, and users who can generate a special substance might be limited in the amount they can generate, such as the Bari Bari no Mi having a maximum barrier size. Some fruits are officially considered superior to others because they possess similar abilities but fewer limitations; for example, the Kiro Kiro no Mi user can make their weight a maximum of 10,000 kilograms (10 metric tons), while the Ton Ton no Mi user can increase their weight to thousands of metric tons. However, having a superior Devil fruit does not automatically make the user superior in combat. Certain Devil Fruits may tax the user's stamina, especially after heavy use. The effects and creations of environment-altering and substance-generating fruits may cease to exist if the user is knocked unconscious or is severely injured. </p>
