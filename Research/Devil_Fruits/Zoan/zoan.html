    <h1>Characteristics</h1>
    <p>Zoan is one of the three Devil Fruit types. This type of Devil Fruit allows a user to transform into an animal species at will, or an inter-species hybrid. Zoan types are especially effective in close combat. Zoan-type Devil Fruits grant the ability to transform into an animal species. Generally, they provide the user with three basic forms: Normal Form, Hybrid Form, Beast Form. However, through training, it is possible for Zoan users to unlock additional transformations; for instance, Marco could transform selective parts of his body, and Chopper could transform into at least seven different forms, even without the use of a Rumble Ball. A majority of the Zoan Devil Fruits come in different groups, known as "series", differentiated by specific species classification, known as "models". These groups are divided based on the different variations of animal; for example, the Jackal, Dachshund, and Wolf Fruits fall into the Inu Inu (Dog) series.</p>
    <p>Some years before the current timeline, Dr. Vegapunk discovered a technique that allows one to make an inanimate object "eat" a Devil Fruit. The details of the technique have not yet been revealed. So far, Zoan is the only type of Devil Fruit that inanimate objects have been shown as being able to absorb. Objects that have "ingested" a Zoan Fruit gain the mobility, abilities, and intelligence of the animal they turn into. This can be a drawback, as the object also gains a living creature's ability to feel pain and fear, and becomes susceptible to disease. The Zoan class Devil Fruit has three known sub-classes that exist beside the standard variety: Ancient, Mythical, and Artificial. The first two are considered to be rarer than regular Zoans.</p>
    <h1>Different Types</h1>
    <h2>Ancient</h2>
    <p>Ancient Zoan is a sub-class of Zoan that allows users to transform into ancient animals, such as dinosaurs. Ancient Zoan Fruits are much rarer than regular Zoans. Ancient Zoan-type powers seem to augment the user's raw physical abilities to a greater extent than standard Zoans, something certainly in keeping with feats exhibited by wielders of Ancient Zoan powers. Furthermore, Ancient Zoans (especially dinosaur models) are noted for bestowing significant durability when their transformation is employed, as well as a fast rate of recovery from battle damage, again more so than normal Zoans. On top of the physical power boost, Ancient Zoan transformations may bestow bodily characteristics that are not seen in modern-day animals, which may be advantageous in combat. Examples include the extremely durable, super-thick skull plate granted by the pachycephalosaurus Zoan. Nine Ancient Zoan powers have been revealed so far, all of which are wielded by (current or former) members of the Beasts Pirates, of the top officer ranks.</p>
    <h2>Mythical</h2>
    <p>Mythical Zoan is a sub-class of Zoan that allows users to transform into creatures that are the subject of myth and legend. It is the rarest type of devil fruit, even more rare than Logia powers. In accordance with their rarity, Mythical Zoan fruits seem to be the most powerful class of Zoan. As with Ancient Zoans, the physical enhancement granted by Mythical Zoan powers is significantly greater than that of standard Zoans. For example, Marco in his phoenix form was able to easily restrain two extremely powerful, fully transformed Ancient Zoan users at once. The most formidable and distinguishing facet of Mythical Zoan fruits is their bestowing of unique, "mythical" abilities that are supplementary to the transformation itself; such as the phoenix Zoan's ability to generate flames with healing properties or the nine-tailed fox Zoan's ability to transform into someone's lookalike. There are even some cases of Mythical Zoan users being able to access these abilities without transforming. Furthermore, a Mythical Zoan fruit may bestow more than a single special ability eg. Kaido's Azure Dragon elements. Seven Mythical Zoan powers have been shown in canon.</p>
    <h2>Artificial</h2>
    <p>Artificial Zoan is a type of Zoan Devil Fruit created through non-natural means. In the Punk Hazard Arc, it is revealed that Dr. Vegapunk attempted to create his own Devil Fruit. However, the resulting fruit was a failure. At a later point, Caesar Clown concocted a substance known as SAD and used it to successfully create specialized Artificial Zoan type Devil Fruits named "SMILEs". Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors, monopolizes SMILEs to create an army of Zoan users in collaboration with Donquixote Doflamingo. Unfortunately, SMILEs only have a 10% success rate. The other 90%, in addition to losing the ability to swim, will lose the ability to express negative emotions and will only be able to smile and laugh, regardless of their true feelings. Unlike normal Devil Fruits, artificial Devil Fruits have ring patterns rather than the typical swirl pattern. It is also shown that SMILE users are vulnerable to Tama's Devil Fruit ability. Artificial Devil Fruits also differ from normal Devil Fruits in that those who eat Artificial Fruits appear to be permanently stuck in hybrid form, unable to change to either full human or full beast form. Furthermore, Artificial Fruits are unique in that they can give fruit users a sentient version of their animal as well. These creatures are shown to be sentient, and separate minds from their users, to the point where they can even quarrel with one another, as seen when Kamijiro attacked Holed'em's crotch while annoyed with Holed'em. Interestingly, despite this individuality mentally, it has been shown that they share the same body and feelings physically, as Kamijiro almost immediately reacted to the pain after Holed'em did.</p>
    <h1>Strenghts</h1>
    <p>The primary strength of Zoan-type fruits is improving the user's physical abilities and attributes, far surpassing the raw physical power of a typical human. This was demonstrated by Lucci and Kaku, whose Rokushiki attacks became exponentially more powerful when they activated their human-beast hybrid forms. Zoan fruits give the user the ability to augment their preexisting strength and abilities with the strength and abilities of the animal that they transform into. As stated by Rob Lucci, Zoan users are able to further increase their physical strength through training. The users of carnivorous Zoan Fruits become more ferocious than other Zoan users and have predatory attributes that are advantageous in combat, such as sharp fangs and claws. In addition to the enhancement of the user's physical might, Zoan fruit powers possess a large variety of useful abilities that are mainly dependent on the kind of animal that the fruit allows the user to transform into. By transforming into the animal form or the animal-human hybrid form, the Zoan user gains the features of the animal that they do not have in their normal state. Mythical Zoan-type users gain these advantages to a more extreme degree, as their animals typically possess special supernatural powers that are impossible for naturally existing animals to possess or obtain. Inanimate object Zoan users possess additional abilities that organic Zoan user do not possess, based on the nature of the object. For example, Funkfreed, a sword with an elephant Zoan can be used to both charge at opponent's as an elephant and cut opponents with its blade.</p>
    <h1>Weaknesses</h1>
    <p>With the exception of certain supernatural abilities granted by Mythical-type fruits, Zoan fruits only enhance the physical attributes of the users' body. Thus, Zoan-type users are unable to affect their environment in the unique ways that many Paramecia and Logia-type fruit users are capable of; at best, their new forms just give them greater protection from physical and environmental peril. Given that Zoan abilities are most effective in close combat, opponents who can use their environment to fight from a distance may reduce a Zoan user's effectiveness. Although Zoan users possess the ability to improve their physical power, they may initially have trouble adjusting to their transformed bodies and utilizing their fighting styles with different physical attributes. New Zoan users can also have difficulty transforming into their hybrid form, potentially resulting in chaos if their full animal form is not suited for their environment, as seen when Kaku fully transformed into a giraffe and fell through the floor. Furthermore, even though Zoan users can increase their abilities when they transform, the users own natural abilities and skills will ultimately affect the results.</p>
    <p> Zoan fruits grant different degrees of intelligence based on what the user is and what kind of creature they transform into. Animals who consume the Hito Hito no Mi will gain the intelligence of a human, while objects with Zoan abilities gain the consciousness of that animal. This may create challenges for people who own animals or objects with Zoan powers. Animals who transform into other animals do not increase their intelligence, and so their ability to utilize advantages granted by their transformation may be limited. Inanimate objects retain their animal consciousness even when in their inanimate form, which may result in their usefulness decreasing if they are afflicted by emotions such as fear. If an animal ate a Zoan-class Devil Fruit that is exactly the same as their original species (such as a human eating the Hito Hito no Mi), it would result in a complete waste, as they gain no transformation whatsoever, yet acquire all the typical weaknesses of Devil Fruit users.</p>
