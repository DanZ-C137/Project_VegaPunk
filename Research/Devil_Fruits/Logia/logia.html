    <h1>Characteristics</h1>
    <p>Logia is the rarest of the three Devil Fruit types. Those who have eaten a Logia fruit are granted the power to transform their body's composition into a natural element at will, as well as create and control it. In addition to enabling the user to generate a near-infinite amount of a certain element and control it, the defining power of a Logia is the user transforming their body into that element. This ability serves to distinguish Logia fruits from other types, particularly Paramecia-type fruits that grant the ability to generate substances. All canon Logia transformations are of elements which are raw and naturally occurring. Logia elements have come in all four major states of matter - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. If a Logia user transforms part of their body and that part is struck physically by a normal body part or object, the user's real body does not take any damage, and any effect of the attack on the user's elemental form is superficial and the body can be reformed with no issue. Logia users must consciously activate their transformation and cannot do so automatically, although experienced users are capable of transforming on reflex, rather than on reaction. There are only a few ways to bypass this transformation and successfully injure a transformed Logia user, with the most common methods being the usage of Seastone and Busoshoku Haki. Additionally, if a Logia user's element can be overwhelmed or canceled out with a different element, those elements have been shown to cancel out their abilities and harm their physical bodies.</p>
    <p>In order to generate their substance, a Logia user must first transform part of their body into the substance which then multiplies as they please; this differs from substance-generating Paramecia users, most of whom can generate substances directly from their physical body or even from thin air. As long as the reproducing substance is attached to the user's body, it is considered part of their body, though it appears that that is no longer the case once the user splits it off. If they encounter their substance in nature, a Logia user can merge with it, and the natural substance will become part of their body as well. The Yami Yami no Mi is quite unlike every other Logia fruit seen so far. Its darkness transformation is not founded in a naturally occurring element, but rather most closely resembles the immense gravitational forces of a black hole that pull in everything, including light. Rather than turning the user's body intangible, the darkness instead amplifies the power of outside strikes which affects the user's body even more. In exchange, however, the user is granted the supernatural ability of being able to cancel out the Devil Fruit ability of any opponent they touch.</p>
    <h1>Strenghts</h1>
    <p>Logias are considered the most powerful type of Devil Fruit, with the most powerful Paramecia fruit, the Gura Gura no Mi, being compared to a Logia in terms of power. With Logias granting the ability to transform into forces of nature and seemingly generate infinite amounts of it, just about every Logia has unfathomable offensive capabilities resembling a concentrated natural disaster. In addition to their potency against opponents, the forces of nature that Logia users transform into can also have a significant effect on their surrounding environment, from the land and water around them, and even to the climate. This was notably seen on Punk Hazard, where a ten-day battle between Magu Magu no Mi user Sakazuki and Hie Hie no Mi user Kuzan caused half of the island to become a hot, fiery land and the other half to become a cold, snowy land. The ability for Logia users to merge with their element means that certain locations make particular Logia users stronger, such as the desert for the Suna Suna no Mi user and gaseous environments for the Gasu Gasu no Mi user. If Logia users are given enough time, their attacks can impact and even destroy areas on an unprecedented scale. Thus, most Logia-type users are capable of unleashing powerful and large-scale attacks rivaled by few.</p>
    <p>Defensively, the bodily intangibility of Logia users when transformed makes them extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the vast majority of the world's population to harm, let alone defeat. Unless one has learned Busoshoku Haki (a skill which is not too common outside the New World), or has managed to acquire an element to cancel out a Logia user's power, their only real chance at injuring a Logia user is to take them by surprise and attack before they can transform, a tactic that the majority of Logia users can easily deal with. Fully transforming their body into an element gives Logia users several advantages, one of those being the ability to disguise themselves by becoming part of their environment. Additionally, fully transformed users are capable of freely manipulating their body's shape at will. Skilled users can utilize this ability to morph their elemental bodies out of the way of attacks that would physically damage them to the point of even forming full fledged holes in their body, as shown by Kuzan and Monet. Additionally, Logia users can use their element to aid their physical bodies, such as when Enel used his lightning to jumpstart his stopped heart. Users who transform into elements that are lighter than air are capable of flight by transforming the lower half of their body. Logia users have also used their abilities to power machines and objects with their elements.</p>
    <h1>Weaknesses</h1>
    <p>The power of Logia fruits can give many untrained users the impression that they are invincible in battle, but this is not the case, especially in dangerous areas like the New World that are full of experienced fighters who know a lot about Devil Fruit abilities. The most common way to bypass Logia protections is by using Busoshoku Haki. Haki does not prevent Logia users from transforming or completely deactivate the transformation; rather, once a Haki-imbued object makes contact with a transformed body, the body part that is struck reverts to its solid form. Thus, a Logia user that is hit with a Haki-imbued attack in their transformed state will be harmed as if they had not transformed. Being in a transformed state may cause the user to expand and occupy a larger surface area than their normal body would, allowing Haki-wielding opponents to strike and injure them with greater ease. Additionally, Logia users may lose their intangibility when their bodies come into contact with an element that has a special reaction with their element. When struck by said element, they are affected in the same way as when they are hit by Busoshoku Haki.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, two Logia elements may completely stalemate upon clashing, such as fire and smoke. Logia users may still be able to outlast and overpower opponents who can bypass their intangibility, and they can use Haki themselves, but being able to bypass intangibility significantly improves a person's chances when fighting Logia users, and they may be able to take the Logia user off-guard, especially if the user is overconfident in their ability. It is possible to trap a transformed Logia user in an enclosed space, especially if their element is solid, and render it difficult to impossible for them to escape. Users with solid and rigid elemental transformations, such as ice, are slower to reform when their elemental bodies are attacked and damaged. A Logia user may be unable to effectively perform and utilize their transformation if they are overwhelmed by an emotion such as fear.</p>
