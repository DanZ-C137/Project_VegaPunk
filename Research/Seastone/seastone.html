  <h1>Origin</h1>
  <p>Seastone is a naturally-occurring, but immensely rare, mineral substance. According to Basil Hawkins, it originates from Wano Country.</p>
  <h1>Properties</h1>
  <p>It was stated by Vice Admiral Smoker that Seastone "gives off a wavelength that is the same as the sea itself" and referred to it as the sea in solid form. It is also said to be as hard as diamond.</p>
  <p>According to Pagaya, Seastone contains a compound known as Pyrobloin, which is sometimes launched into the sky as "corneous particles" due to volcanic eruptions. In the sky, the Pyrobloin particles absorb moisture and form either Island Clouds or Sea Clouds, depending on the density of the water vapor.</p>
  <p>Upon contact with a Devil Fruit user, Seastone will drain the Devil Fruit user of their stamina and nullify their powers. Coming into contact with Seastone has the same effect on a Devil Fruit user as if they fell into the sea, minus the risk of drowning. This weakening effect only works upon direct and constant physical contact with the Devil Fruit user in question, the effect stops immediately once the Devil Fruit user is no longer in contact with the substance. The degree of "weakness" induced by the Seastone depends on its density and composition, 100% pure Seastone having the greatest weakening effect on Devil Fruit users.</p>
  <p>Devil Fruit users can feel the energy coming from a Seastone object, even from a distance.</p>
  <h1>Uses</h1>
  <p>Because Seastone is as strong as diamond, and because it is such an effective countermeasure against Devil Fruit users, it is often used by various organizations to make a variety of weapons, such as blades or bullets, and restraints, such as shackles or cages.</p>
  <p>Wano Country has many craftsmen who have expertise in working with the mineral and are the only ones skilled enough to forge it into delicate items, such as nails.</p>
  <p>Vegapunk has discovered that Seastone can mask the presence of a ship from Sea Kings and other sea-dwellers, and therefore had the bottom of Marine ships covered in a layer of it, which is especially useful when traveling across the Calm Belt. However, the Sea Kings can still see the ship, so it is not an absolute protection.</p>
